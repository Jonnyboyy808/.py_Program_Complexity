# .py_Program_Complexity
Tracking changes in performance across commits

- The repository i analyzed contained a python program that counted words. 
- The first step of the project was tracking how the .py file has grown and changed over time and who has made those changes to the repo. 
- Next, given the .py program counted words, I passed three test strings into my own function "run_wc" that ran every commit of the word counter to see which commits running the .py file matched what was expected and which didn't. 
- To test performance of the different commits, four were chosen to run the .py program on X randomly generated words and Y chosen unique words from X and the times were recorded. 
-Lastly, since version one and two were the fastest, I wanted to visualize the difference in complexity as the words got more and more unique.
